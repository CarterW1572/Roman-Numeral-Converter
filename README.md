# Roman-Numeral-Converter
Converts Roman numerals to decimal and from decimal back to Roman numerals.
The main function takes in an input file from the command line and reads all the Roman numerals from that file, which shoud be seperated by newlines. It then uses functions from the Scanner header file to convert the Roman numerals to decimals and from decimals back to Roman numerals.
This took me about 2 and a half hours to complete.
